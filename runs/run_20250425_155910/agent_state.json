Write Python code using the `pretty_midi` library.\n2. The code should create a 2-4 bar DRUMS ONLY pattern appropriate for the rock.\n3. Use IS_DRUM=True for the percussion instrument.\n4. Create a strong rhythmic foundation with kick, snare, hi-hat, and other percussion.\n5. Define a structure that could support melody and harmony later.\n6. **CRITICAL:** The code MUST save the final MIDI object to a file path specified by the variable `output_path`. This variable will be provided to your code when executed.\n7. Return ONLY the Python code, wrapped in `<CODE>...</CODE>` tags. Do NOT include explanations, imports outside the code block, or example usage.\n\nSUCCESS CRITERIA:\n- Response contains ONLY the <CODE>...</CODE> block.\n- The code creates ONLY drums (percussion) - NO other instruments yet.\n- The rhythm pattern is 2-4 bars long with clear structure.\n- The code saves the result using `midi_object.write(output_path)`.\n- The code is executable Python.\n\nFAILURE MODES TO AVOID:\n- Adding non-percussion instruments (these will be added in later iterations).\n- Not saving the file to the `output_path` variable.\n- Including explanations or any text outside the `<CODE>...</CODE>` tags.\n\nEXAMPLE RESPONSE:\n<CODE>\nimport pretty_midi\nimport random\n\n# rock style rhythm pattern\ntempo = 110\nbeats_per_bar = 4\nnum_bars = 2\nbeat_duration = 60/tempo\n\n# Create MIDI object\nmidi_object = pretty_midi.PrettyMIDI(initial_tempo=tempo)\n\n# Create drum instrument\ndrums = pretty_midi.Instrument(program=0, is_drum=True)\n\n# Define MIDI note numbers for common drum sounds\nkick = 36\nsnare = 38\nclosed_hihat = 42\nopen_hihat = 46\ncrash = 49\nride = 51\ntom_mid = 47\n\n# Create a basic drum pattern\nfor bar in range(num_bars):\n    bar_start = bar * beats_per_bar * beat_duration\n    \n    #

Identify which ITERATION NUMBER this is and add the appropriate instrument:\n   * ITERATION 2: Add a BASS LINE (use instruments 32-39 like Acoustic Bass or Fretless Bass)\n   * ITERATION 3: Add a MELODY instrument (consider saxophone, trumpet, flute, or piano)\n   * ITERATION 4: Add HARMONY/CHORDS (piano, guitar, or synth pads)\n   * ITERATION 5+: Add ORNAMENTATION (fills, arpeggios, background elements)\n\n2. PRESERVE EXISTING INSTRUMENTS and build on them. DO NOT remove existing instruments.\n\n3. Return ONLY a strictly valid JSON object with the required mutation parameters, wrapped in <PARAMS>...</PARAMS> tags:\n   - mutation_description: Detailed explanation of what instrument you're adding and how\n   - transpose_semitones: Change key if needed (0 for no change)\n   - velocity_change: Adjust overall volume/dynamics \n   - add_note_probability: Should be 0.9+ for this use case (you WANT to add notes)\n   - remove_note_probability: Should be VERY LOW (0.01) to preserve existing parts\n   - instrument_program: The NEW instrument you're adding (must be a number 0-127)\n\nSUCCESS CRITERIA:\n- Response contains ONLY the <PARAMS>...</PARAMS> block with the required parameters\n- The JSON inside the tags is strictly valid (no leading zeros on numbers)\n- Mutation focuses on ADDING a new instrument layer rather than changing existing ones\n\nEXAMPLE FOR ITERATION 2:\n<PARAMS>\n{\n  \"mutation_description\": \"Adding a walking bass line in the style of jazz using Acoustic Bass (instrument 32).
