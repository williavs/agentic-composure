Write Python code using the `pretty_midi` library.\n2. The code should create a 2-4 bar DRUMS ONLY pattern appropriate for the rock.\n3. Use IS_DRUM=True for the percussion instrument.\n4. Create a strong rhythmic foundation with kick, snare, hi-hat, and other percussion.\n5. Define a structure that could support melody and harmony later.\n6. **CRITICAL:** The code MUST save the final MIDI object to a file path specified by the variable `output_path`. This variable will be provided to your code when executed.\n7. Return ONLY the Python code, wrapped in `<CODE>...</CODE>` tags. Do NOT include explanations, imports outside the code block, or example usage.\n\nSUCCESS CRITERIA:\n- Response contains ONLY the <CODE>...</CODE> block.\n- The code creates ONLY drums (percussion) - NO other instruments yet.\n- The rhythm pattern is 2-4 bars long with clear structure.\n- The code saves the result using `midi_object.write(output_path)`.\n- The code is executable Python.\n\nFAILURE MODES TO AVOID:\n- Adding non-percussion instruments (these will be added in later iterations).\n- Not saving the file to the `output_path` variable.\n- Including explanations or any text outside the `<CODE>...</CODE>` tags.\n\nEXAMPLE RESPONSE:\n<CODE>\nimport pretty_midi\nimport random\n\n# rock style rhythm pattern\ntempo = 110\nbeats_per_bar = 4\nnum_bars = 2\nbeat_duration = 60/tempo\n\n# Create MIDI object\nmidi_object = pretty_midi.PrettyMIDI(initial_tempo=tempo)\n\n# Create drum instrument\ndrums = pretty_midi.Instrument(program=0, is_drum=True)\n\n# Define MIDI note numbers for common drum sounds\nkick = 36\nsnare = 38\nclosed_hihat = 42\nopen_hihat = 46\ncrash = 49\nride = 51\ntom_mid = 47\n\n# Create a basic drum pattern\nfor bar in range(num_bars):\n    bar_start = bar * beats_per_bar * beat_duration\n    \n    # Kick on beats 1 and 3\n    for beat in [0, 2]:\n        drums.notes.append(\n            pretty_midi.Note(\n                velocity=100,\n                pitch=kick,\n                start=bar_start + beat * beat_duration,\n                end=bar_start + beat * beat_duration + 0.1\n            )\n        )\n    \n    # Snare on beats 2 and 4\n    for beat in [1, 3]:\n        drums.notes.append(\n            pretty_midi.Note(\n                velocity=90,\n                pitch=snare,\n                start=bar_start + beat * beat_duration,\n                end=bar_start + beat * beat_duration + 0.1\n            )\n        )\n    \n    # Hi-hat on every eighth note\n    for beat in range(beats_per_bar * 2):\n        drums.notes.append(\n            pretty_midi.Note(\n                velocity=80 if beat % 2 == 0 else 60,\n                pitch=closed_hihat,\n                start=bar_start + beat * beat_duration/2,\n                end=bar_start + beat * beat_duration/2 + 0.05\n            )\n        )\n    \n    # Crash at start of first bar only\n    if bar == 0:\n        drums.notes.append(\n            pretty_midi.Note(\n                velocity=100,\n                pitch=crash,\n                start=bar_start,\n                end=bar_start + 0.3\n            )\n        )\n\n# Add drums to MIDI object\nmidi_object.instruments.append(drums)\n\n# Save to output path\nmidi_object.write(output_path)\n</CODE>\n", "agent_response": "<CODE>\nimport pretty_midi\n\ntempo = 120\nbeats_per_bar = 4\nnum_bars = 4\nbeat_duration = 60 / tempo\n\nmidi_object = pretty_midi.PrettyMIDI(initial_tempo=tempo)\ndrums = pretty_midi.Instrument(program=0, is_drum=True)\n\nkick = 36\nsnare = 38\nclosed_hihat = 42\nopen_hihat = 46\ncrash = 49\nlow_tom = 45\n\nfor bar in range(num_bars):\n    bar_start = bar * beats_per_bar * beat_duration\n\n    # Kick on 1, 1.5, and 3 (classic backbeat)\n    for beat in [0, 1.5, 2]:\n        drums.notes.append(\n            pretty_midi.Note(\n                velocity=105,\n                pitch=kick,\n                start=bar_start + beat * beat_duration,\n                end=bar_start + beat * beat_duration + 0.12\n            )\n        )\n\n    # Snare on 2 and 4\n    for beat in [1, 3]:\n        drums.notes.append(\n            pretty_midi.Note(\n                velocity=112,\n                pitch=snare,\n                start=bar_start + beat * beat_duration,\n                end=bar_start + beat * beat_duration + 0.11\n            )\n        )\n\n    # Closed hi-hat eighths\n    for eighth in range(beats_per_bar * 2):\n        hh_vel = 85 if eighth % 2 == 0 else 75\n        drums.notes.append(\n            pretty_midi.Note(\n                velocity=hh_vel,\n                pitch=closed_hihat,\n                start=bar_start + eighth * (beat_duration / 2),\n                end=bar_start + eighth * (beat_duration / 2) + 0.05\n            )\n        )\n\n    # Crash on downbeat of first bar and third bar\n    if bar == 0 or bar == 2:\n        drums.notes.append(\n            pretty_midi.Note(\n                velocity=127,\n                pitch=crash,\n                start=bar_start,\n                end=bar_start + 0.3\n            )\n        )\n\n    # Open hi-hat on the '&' of 4 in the last bar (for groove)\n    if bar == num_bars -
