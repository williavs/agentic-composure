Write Python code using the `pretty_midi` library.\n2. The code should create a 2-4 bar DRUMS ONLY pattern appropriate for the rock.\n3. Use IS_DRUM=True for the percussion instrument.\n4. Create a strong rhythmic foundation with kick, snare, hi-hat, and other percussion.\n5. Define a structure that could support melody and harmony later.\n6. **CRITICAL:** The code MUST save the final MIDI object to a file path specified by the variable `output_path`. This variable will be provided to your code when executed.\n7. Return ONLY the Python code, wrapped in `<CODE>...</CODE>` tags. Do NOT include explanations, imports outside the code block, or example usage.\n\nSUCCESS CRITERIA:\n- Response contains ONLY the <CODE>...</CODE> block.\n- The code creates ONLY drums (percussion) - NO other instruments yet.\n- The rhythm pattern is 2-4 bars long with clear structure.\n- The code saves the result using `midi_object.write(output_path)`.\n- The code is executable Python.\n\nFAILURE MODES TO AVOID:\n- Adding non-percussion instruments (these will be added in later iterations).\n- Not saving the file to the `output_path` variable.\n- Including explanations or any text outside the `<CODE>...</CODE>` tags.\n\nEXAMPLE RESPONSE:\n<CODE>\nimport pretty_midi\nimport random\n\n# rock style rhythm pattern\ntempo = 110\nbeats_per_bar = 4\nnum_bars = 2\nbeat_duration = 60/tempo\n\n# Create MIDI object\nmidi_object = pretty_midi.PrettyMIDI(initial_tempo=tempo)\n\n# Create drum instrument\ndrums = pretty_midi.Instrument(program=0, is_drum=True)\n\n# Define MIDI note numbers for common drum sounds\nkick = 36\nsnare = 38\nclosed_hihat = 42\nopen_hihat = 46\ncrash = 49\nride = 51\ntom_mid = 47\n\n# Create a basic drum pattern\nfor bar in range(num_bars):\n    bar_start = bar * beats_per_bar * beat_duration\n    \n    # Kick on beats 1 and 3\n    for beat in [0, 2]:\n        drums.notes.append(\n            pretty_midi.Note(\n                velocity=100,\n                pitch=kick,\n                start=bar_start + beat * beat_duration,\n                end=bar_start + beat * beat_duration + 0.1\n            )\n        )\n    \n    # Snare on beats 2 and 4\n    for beat in [1, 3]:\n        drums.notes.append(\n            pretty_midi.Note(\n                velocity=90,\n                pitch=snare,\n                start=bar_start + beat * beat_duration,\n                end=bar_start + beat * beat_duration + 0.1\n            )\n        )\n    \n    # Hi-hat on every eighth note\n    for beat in range(beats_per_bar * 2):\n        drums.notes.append(\n            pretty_midi.Note(\n                velocity=80 if beat % 2 == 0 else 60,\n                pitch=closed_hihat,\n                start=bar_start + beat * beat_duration/2,\n                end=bar_start + beat * beat_duration/2 + 0.05\n            )\n        )\n    \n    # Crash at start of first bar only\n    if bar == 0:\n        drums.notes.append(\n            pretty_midi.Note(\n                velocity=100,\n                pitch=crash,\n                start=bar_start,\n                end=bar_start + 0.3\n            )\n        )\n\n# Add drums to MIDI object\nmidi_object.instruments.append(drums)\n\n# Save to output path\nmidi_object.write(output_path)\n</CODE>\n", "agent_response": "<CODE>\nimport pretty_midi\n\ntempo = 120\nbeats_per_bar = 4\nnum_bars = 4\nbeat_duration = 60 / tempo\n\n# Create MIDI object\nmidi_object = pretty_midi.PrettyMIDI(initial_tempo=tempo)\n\n# Set up rock drum kit\ndrums = pretty_midi.Instrument(program=0, is_drum=True)\n\n# Drum sound MIDI notes\nkick = 36         # Bass Drum 1\nsnare = 38        # Acoustic Snare\nclosed_hihat = 42 # Closed Hi-hat\nopen_hihat = 46   # Open Hi-hat\ncrash = 49        # Crash Cymbal 1\ntom_high = 50     # High Tom\ntom_mid = 47      # Mid Tom\n\nfor bar in range(num_bars):\n    bar_start = bar * beats_per_bar * beat_duration\n    \n    # Kick drum on beats 1 and 3, with an extra on 1-e (rock style)\n    drums.notes.append(\n        pretty_midi.Note(velocity=110, pitch=kick, \n                         start=bar_start + 0, \n                         end=bar_start + 0.12))\n    drums.notes.append(\n        pretty_midi.Note(velocity=95, pitch=kick, \n                         start=bar_start + 0.30 * beat_duration, \n                         end=bar_start + 0.30 * beat_duration + 0.12))\n    drums.notes.append(\n        pretty_midi.Note(velocity=100, pitch=kick, \n                         start=bar_start + 2 * beat_duration, \n                         end=bar_start + 2 * beat_duration + 0.12))\n    \n    # Snare drum on beats 2 and 4\n    for beat in [1, 3]:\n        drums.notes.append(\n            pretty_midi.Note(velocity=105, pitch=snare, \n                             start=bar_start + beat * beat_duration, \n                             end=bar_start + beat * beat_duration + 0.12))\n    \n    # Closed hi-hat on every eighth note\n    for eighth in range(8):\n        time = bar_start + (eighth * beat_duration/2)\n        drums.notes.append(\n            pretty_midi.Note(velocity=75 + (10 if eighth % 2 == 0 else 0),\n                             pitch=closed_hihat,\n                             start=time,\n                             end=time + 0.06))\n    \n    # Open hi-hat on the \"and\" of 4 in the final bar only\n    if bar == num_bars -

Identify which ITERATION NUMBER this is and add the appropriate instrument:\n   * ITERATION 2: Add a BASS LINE (use instruments 32-39 like Acoustic Bass or Fretless Bass)\n   * ITERATION 3: Add a MELODY instrument (consider saxophone, trumpet, flute, or piano)\n   * ITERATION 4: Add HARMONY/CHORDS (piano, guitar, or synth pads)\n   * ITERATION 5+: Add ORNAMENTATION (fills, arpeggios, background elements)\n\n2. PRESERVE EXISTING INSTRUMENTS and build on them. DO NOT remove existing instruments.\n\n3. PREFERRED: Write Python code using the `pretty_midi` library to LOAD the existing MIDI file (from the variable `midi_path`), ADD a new instrument layer (as described above), and SAVE the result to the file path specified by the variable `output_path`. The code should:\n   - Use the provided `midi_path` and `output_path` variables (do not hardcode file paths).\n   - Add a new instrument (not overwrite existing ones).\n   - Be wrapped in <CODE>...</CODE> tags, with NO explanation or text outside the code block.\n   - Be executable as-is (imports included inside the code block).\n   - Reference the UNDERTALE Music Sample List for authentic instrument, detuning, and arrangement choices. Add code comments for any effects or mixing tips.\n\n4. ALTERNATIVE (if code is not possible): Return ONLY a strictly valid JSON object with the required mutation parameters, wrapped in <PARAMS>...</PARAMS> tags:\n   - mutation_description: Detailed explanation of what instrument you're adding and how\n   - transpose_semitones: Change key if needed (0 for no change)\n   - velocity_change: Adjust overall volume/dynamics \n   - add_note_probability: Should be 0.9+ for this use case (you WANT to add notes)\n   - remove_note_probability: Should be VERY LOW (0.01) to preserve existing parts\n   - instrument_program: The NEW instrument you're adding (must be a number 0-127)\n\nSUCCESS CRITERIA:\n- Response contains ONLY the <CODE>...</CODE> block (preferred) or <PARAMS>...</PARAMS> block (fallback).\n- The code loads the existing MIDI, adds a new instrument, and saves to `output_path`.\n- The code is executable Python and self-contained.\n- If JSON is used, it is strictly valid (no leading zeros on numbers).\n- Mutation focuses on ADDING a new instrument layer rather than changing existing ones.\n- Code comments should indicate any effects or mixing tips inspired by the sample list.\n\nEXAMPLE CODE RESPONSE:\n<CODE>\nimport pretty_midi\n# Load existing MIDI\nmidi = pretty_midi.PrettyMIDI(midi_path)\n# Create new instrument (e.g., bass)\nbass = pretty_midi.Instrument(program=32)\n# Add notes to bass (example: walking bass)\nfor i in range(8):\n    note = pretty_midi.Note(velocity=80, pitch=36 + (i % 4), start=i*0.5, end=i*0.5+0.4)\n    bass.notes.append(note)\n# Example: Detune bass by -2 semitones for authenticity (see sample list)\nfor note in bass.notes:\n    note.pitch -= 2\nmidi.instruments.append(bass)\n# Save to output_path\nmidi.write(output_path)\n# Tip: Add reverb to bass in your DAW for a more authentic UNDERTALE sound\n</CODE>\n\nEXAMPLE JSON RESPONSE:\n<PARAMS>\n{\n  \"mutation_description\": \"Adding a walking bass line in the style of jazz using Acoustic Bass (instrument 32).

Identify which ITERATION NUMBER this is and add the appropriate instrument:\n   * ITERATION 2: Add a BASS LINE (use instruments 32-39 like Acoustic Bass or Fretless Bass)\n   * ITERATION 3: Add a MELODY instrument (consider saxophone, trumpet, flute, or piano)\n   * ITERATION 4: Add HARMONY/CHORDS (piano, guitar, or synth pads)\n   * ITERATION 5+: Add ORNAMENTATION (fills, arpeggios, background elements)\n\n2. PRESERVE EXISTING INSTRUMENTS and build on them. DO NOT remove existing instruments.\n\n3. PREFERRED: Write Python code using the `pretty_midi` library to LOAD the existing MIDI file (from the variable `midi_path`), ADD a new instrument layer (as described above), and SAVE the result to the file path specified by the variable `output_path`. The code should:\n   - Use the provided `midi_path` and `output_path` variables (do not hardcode file paths).\n   - Add a new instrument (not overwrite existing ones).\n   - Be wrapped in <CODE>...</CODE> tags, with NO explanation or text outside the code block.\n   - Be executable as-is (imports included inside the code block).\n   - Reference the UNDERTALE Music Sample List for authentic instrument, detuning, and arrangement choices.
