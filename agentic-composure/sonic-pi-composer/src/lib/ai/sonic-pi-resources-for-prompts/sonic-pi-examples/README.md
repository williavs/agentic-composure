# sonic-pi-examples 

We got very inspired by the talks at [eurucamp 2015](http://2015.eurucamp.org/), e.g. regarding live coding and making music using Ruby or programming languages in general.

Let's have a try and make music! And let's share our progress and examples. That is the purpose this org was created for. As a starting point, there is a repo for sonic-pi examples, prefilled with a *very* simple trial of a german children's song. Add yours if you like! And don't worry - it doesn't have to be complete, it doesn't have to be genius, the goal is just having fun by learning making music.
