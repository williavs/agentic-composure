# Examples

Check out a variety of sample implementations of the SDK in the examples section of the [repo](https://github.com/openai/openai-agents-python/tree/main/examples). The examples are organized into several categories that demonstrate different patterns and capabilities.

## Categories

  * **[agent_patterns](https://github.com/openai/openai-agents-python/tree/main/examples/agent_patterns):** Examples in this category illustrate common agent design patterns, such as

    * Deterministic workflows
    * Agents as tools
    * Parallel agent execution
  * **[basic](https://github.com/openai/openai-agents-python/tree/main/examples/basic):** These examples showcase foundational capabilities of the SDK, such as

    * Dynamic system prompts
    * Streaming outputs
    * Lifecycle events
  * **[tool examples](https://github.com/openai/openai-agents-python/tree/main/examples/tools):** Learn how to implement OAI hosted tools such as web search and file search, and integrate them into your agents.

  * **[model providers](https://github.com/openai/openai-agents-python/tree/main/examples/model_providers):** Explore how to use non-OpenAI models with the SDK.

  * **[handoffs](https://github.com/openai/openai-agents-python/tree/main/examples/handoffs):** See practical examples of agent handoffs.

  * **[mcp](https://github.com/openai/openai-agents-python/tree/main/examples/mcp):** Learn how to build agents with MCP.

  * **[customer_service](https://github.com/openai/openai-agents-python/tree/main/examples/customer_service)** and **[research_bot](https://github.com/openai/openai-agents-python/tree/main/examples/research_bot):** Two more built-out examples that illustrate real-world applications

    * **customer_service** : Example customer service system for an airline.
    * **research_bot** : Simple deep research clone.
  * **[voice](https://github.com/openai/openai-agents-python/tree/main/examples/voice):** See examples of voice agents, using our TTS and STT models.
